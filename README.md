OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECT

PROJECT : PREDICTIVE MODELING WITH LINEAR REGRESSION

OBEJECTIVE To implement a simple linear regression model for predicting continuous target variables, evaluate its performance, and visualize the results.

KEY FEATURES :

1.Data Preprocessing - Splitting data into training and testing sets. 2.Model Training - Using Linear Regression to learn relationships in the data. 3.Evaluation Metrics - Measuring performance with Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (RÂ²). 4.Visualization - Plotting regression lines and actual vs predicted values for accuracy assessment.

TECHNLOGY USED : Python - Programming Language. Libraries/Modules: NumPy - Data generation and numerical computations. Pandas - (Optional) Data manipulation (not used in the provided code). Matplotlib - Data visualization. Scikit-learn - Model implementation, training, testing, and evaluation.
